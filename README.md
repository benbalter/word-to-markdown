# Word to Markdown converter

A Ruby gem to liberate content from [the jail that is Word documents](http://ben.balter.com/2012/10/19/we-ve-been-trained-to-make-paper/#jailbreaking-content)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/benbalter/word-to-markdown.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/benbalter/word-to-markdown) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/word-to-markdown.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/word-to-markdown) [![Inline docs](http://inch-pages.github.io/github/benbalter/word-to-markdown.png)](http://inch-pages.github.io/github/benbalter/word-to-markdown)

## The problem

> Our default content publishing workflow is terribly broken. [We've all been trained to make paper](http://ben.balter.com/2012/10/19/we-ve-been-trained-to-make-paper/), yet today, content authored once is more commonly consumed in multiple formats, and rarely, if ever, does it embody physical form. Put another way, our go-to content authoring workflow remains relatively unchanged since it was conceived in the early 80s.

> I'm asked regularly by government employees — knowledge workers who fire up a desktop word processor as the first step to any project — for an automated pipeline to convert Microsoft Word documents to [Markdown](http://guides.github.com/overviews/mastering-markdown/), the *lingua franca* of the internet, but as my recent foray into building [just such a converter](http://word-to-markdown.herokuapp.com/) proves, it's not that simple.

> Markdown isn't just an alternative format. Markdown forces you to write for the web.

## Testing

```
script/cibuild
```

## Server

The development version of the gem contains a lightweight server for converting Word Documents as a service.

To run the server, simply run `script/server` and open `localhost:9292` in your browser. The server can also be run on Heroku.

A live version runs at [word-to-markdown.herokuapp.com](http://word-to-markdown.herokuapp.com).

You can also use it as a service by posting raw HTML to `/raw`, which will return the raw markdown in response.
